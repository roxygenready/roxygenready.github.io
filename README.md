## Create Roxygen skeletons for all of your functions before compiling it into an R package.


[**Roxygen2**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html) is an awesome tool to easily create a package from your function library. 

[**RoxygenReady**](https://github.com/vertesy/RoxygenReady) helps in creating the function annotations needed to compile a proper package by **Roxygen2**. 

More precisely, **RoxygenReady** creates *Roxygen skeletons*, a certain format for inline function annotation (see below). By so, it spares you a lot of time documenting your functions easily and precisely. 

The annotation skeleton it creates, can be automatically compiled into a package with a few lines of code. Packages are the standard way of distribution R code, as they integrate with other services, code sharing becomes much easier. *See the installation section for an example.*

##### You can pass a whole file to **RoxygenReady**, and it will create *Roxygen skeletons* for all functions defined in the file!

<br><br>
## Installation and Usage

1. Install directly from **GitHub** via **devtools** with one R command:

    `devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/RoxygenReady/RoxygenReady")`
    
2. ...then simply load the package:

    `require("RoxygenReady")`
     
    
3. and create Roxygen skeletons for your functions


    `RoxygenReady("Path/to/your/script.r")`


<br><br>
## Workflow Explained: *a streamlined package creation*

### 1. You start out with your .R file containing your favorite functions.

 		print11more <- function(n=1, m=1) { # a function with real added value
			print (n+(11*m))
		}

	- RoxygenReady expects a short description in the first line, after the `{` character, which will be parsed into the description field of the function annotation.


### 2. Construct *Roxygen skeletons* RoxygenReady from all functions in your script.

		#' print11more
		#'
		#' # a function with real added value
		#' @param n
		#' @param m
		#' @examples print11more(n=1, m=1)
		#' @export


		print11more <- function(n=1, m=1) {
			print (n+(11*m))
		}


### 3. Compile your package by roxygen.

	- See section: **How to create an R package?**


### 4. Installing your package and share via GitHub!


       install.packages(YourPackage)
       require(YourPackage)

Browse for help on your functions `help(print11more)`:

You can share your package on **GitHub**, and everyone can super easily install it, like this package: read on!

## Package content

A couple of functions to generate inline description from your functions, using their names and arguments as default input. These can be later parsed by Roxygen to an R package's help section.

2. [Browse the code of the functions](https://github.com/vertesy/RoxygenReady/blob/master/RoxygenReady/R/RoxygenReady.R)

## How to create an R package?
> check: Workflow_to_Create_an_R_Package.R for details

1. Write or collect your favorite functions into an R script.
- **Prepare** in-line documentation **with RoxygenReady**
- Create a new package by **roxygen2**'s `create()` function, copy your functions script.
- Explain parameters in the in-line annotation; manually :-(
- **Compile** a package & documentation **by roxygen2**
- **Install** your package locally
- Test your package
- Share it with others via **GitHub**

<br>


## [Examples](https://github.com/vertesy/RoxygenReady/tree/master/Examples)

1. Go through the [example scripts](https://github.com/vertesy/RoxygenReady/tree/master/Examples) to understand how the package works.
